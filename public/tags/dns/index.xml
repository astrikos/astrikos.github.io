Recently we took the decision to allow services from different clusters to be able to discover each other. Since we were already using Istio we decided to leverage Istio’s multi cluster capability.
After preparing our setup and testing it with some of our home grown tools, we tried to switch one of our lower traffic services to use Istio’s multi cluster discovery.</description></item><item><title>Yet Another Kubernetes DNS Latency Story</title><link>https://astrikos.github.io/2020/10/yet-another-kubernetes-dns-latency-story/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astrikos.github.io/2020/10/yet-another-kubernetes-dns-latency-story/</guid><description>In previous Beat articles we talked about the importance of DNS in our Kubernetes clusters and how we managed to scale through different techniques. We also mentioned that one of the upcoming versions of Kubernetes would provide the ultimate way to handle our DNS problems and give us some peace of mind while working on other parts. At Beat, we use kops to provision and maintain our cluster so we opted on waiting until kops would support it.</description></item></channel></rss>
