      <description>Beat’s infrastructure architecture consists of multiple islands that each one of them contains a separate Kubernetes cluster.

After preparing our setup and testing it with some of our home grown tools, we tried to switch one of our lower traffic services to use Istio’s multi cluster discovery.</description>
